# Documentation

This is the documentation for the Myria project. You can download all the components through this [repository](https://github.com/uwescience/myria-stack).

To get started with Myria, take a look at the [MyriaX](myriaX.html) engine. 

After you setup the engine, you can upload data and run queries through the [Python](myriapython.html) API. An alternative way to run queries is via the [myria-web](myriaweb.html) interface. 

For any questions, see the [FAQ](faq.html) or contact us if you don't see your question listed.
