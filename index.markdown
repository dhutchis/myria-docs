# Documentation

This is the documentation for the Myria project.

To get started with Myria, look at [setup](setup.html). 

If you'd like to use the web interface, check out [myria-web](myriaweb.html).

As an alternative to myria-web, you can also send queries to myria via [python](myriapython.html).

For any questions, see the [FAQ](faq.html) or contact us if you don't see your question listed.
