# Documentation

This is the documentation for the Myria project. You can download all the components through this [repository](https://github.com/uwescience/myria-stack).

For an overall view of Myria as a cloud service and a big data management system, see our demo [paper](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/publications/Halperin_Myria_demo_SIGMOD_2014.pdf).

To get started with Myria, take a look at the [MyriaX](myriaX.html) engine. 

After you setup the engine, you can upload data and run queries through the [Python](myriapython.html) API. An alternative way to run queries is via the [Myria Web](myriaweb.html) interface. To learn more about the Myria query language, check out the [MyriaL](myriaql.html) page. 

For those interested in developing with Myria, check out our [Myria Developer](developer.html) page. 

For any questions, see the [FAQ](faq.html) or contact us if you don't see your question listed.
